# ACM-assignment1

My first assignment for Advanced Cognitive Modelling at AU.

To run the simulation experiments outlined in the main text first install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```python
python simulations.py
```

This will run all simulations and output plots of win rates and belief updates to the `figures/` directory.
